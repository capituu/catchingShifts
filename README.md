# Catching Shifts

A collection of scripts used to interact with the SkipTheDishes courier APIs. Some utilities rely on launching a local installation of Chrome or Chromium via Pyppeteer.

## Environment Variables

- **PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH**: Absolute path to the Chrome/Chromium executable used by the `auth_code_capture.py` script. Set this variable before running the script so it can locate your browser.
